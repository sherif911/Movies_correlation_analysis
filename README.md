🎬 Movie Data Analysis & Correlation Study

This project explores relationships between movie attributes such as budget, gross revenue, and IMDb score using Python data analysis and visualization tools. The goal is to understand which factors are most strongly correlated with a movie’s financial success.

📊 Project Overview

In this analysis, we:

Load and clean a movie dataset

Inspect missing data

Remove duplicate records

Sort movies by gross revenue

Visualize relationships using regression plots

Compute and visualize a correlation matrix for numeric features

The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib – data visualization

Seaborn – statistical visualizations

📁 Dataset

File: movies.csv

The dataset includes information such as:

Budget

Gross revenue

IMDb score

Other movie-related metadata

📌 The dataset is loaded locally (e.g. Google Drive path). Update the file path as needed.

🔍 Analysis Steps

Import Libraries

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Open the notebook/script in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Update the dataset path if needed

Run the cells sequentially

📌 Key Insight

Initial results suggest that budget has a strong positive correlation with gross revenue, while IMDb score shows a weaker relationship with financial performance.
